Problem 1:

A little girl living in a village craves some rava idli even though she has had rava idli for the last 346514534 days in a row !! (Strange, you might think. But its normal down here)

At the idli shop there are two types of Rava Idli's available.

One goes for Rs.A per piece and the other goes for Rs.B per piece.
The girl has a total of K rupees.

What is the maximum number of rava idlis that she can have?

Note that she does not care about the type of idli she gets, she just wants to have as many rava idlis of any type as possible.

Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T
1 = T = 1000
Each test case contains three integers, A, B and K.
1 = A,B,K = 10^9

Output

Print the maximum number of idlis she can buy for each test case on a new line

Problem 2:
You are given a positive integer . Print a numerical triangle of height  like the one below:

1
22
333
4444
55555
......
Can you do it using only arithmetic operations, a single for loop and print statement?

Use no more than two lines. The first line (the for statement) is already written for you. You have to complete the print statement.

Note: Using anything related to strings will give a score of .

Input Format
A single line containing integer

Problem 3:
You are given a rectangular board of M×N squares. Also you are given an unlimited number of standard domino pieces of 2×1 squares. You are allowed to rotate the pieces. You are asked to place as many dominoes as possible on the board so as to meet the following conditions:

1.Each domino completely covers two squares.

2.No two dominoes overlap.

3.Each domino lies entirely inside the board. It is allowed to touch the edges of the board.

Find the maximum number of dominoes, which can be placed under these restrictions.

Input Format

In a single line you are given two integers M and N — board sizes in squares

Constraints

1=M=N=16

Output Format

Output one number — the maximal number of dominoes, which can be placed.

Problem 4:

Given an integer,n, perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer,n.

Constraints

1<=n<=100

Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird

Sample Input 0

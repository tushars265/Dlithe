Problem 2:
Problem Description
Rotate a given String in the specified direction by specified magnitude.
After each rotation make a note of the first character of the rotated String, After all rotation are performed the accumulated first character as noted previously will form another string, say FIRSTCHARSTRING.
Check If FIRSTCHARSTRING is an Anagram of any substring of the Original string.
If yes print "YES" otherwise "NO". Input
The first line contains the original string s. The second line contains a single integer q. The ith of the next q lines contains character d[i] denoting direction and integer r[i] denoting the magnitude.

Constraints
1 <= Length of original string <= 30
1<= q <= 10

Output
YES or NO

Example 1
Input
carrace
 3
 L 2
 R 2
 L 3


Output
NO


Problem 3:
Stubborn Vowels
In english alphabets there are two types of words, vowels and consonents.You are writing a program to reverse a given string, but the vowels are stubborn to move away from their position. So given a string where the vowels are stubborn,
print what will be word if the entire word is reversed except for the vowels.

Input Format
One string input

Constraints
3<=String length<=10^5

Output Format
Reversed string output

Sample Input 0
missing

Sample Output 0
ngissim

Explanation 0
m + i + ss + i + ng = ng + i + ss + n The string are taken as fragments {m,ss,ng} and the set is reversed and placed
between the vowels.

Problem 4:
Array of integers is a hill, if:

it is strictly increasing in the beginning; after that it is constant; after that it is strictly decreasing.
The first block (increasing) and the last block (decreasing) may be absent. It is allowed that both of this blocks are absent.
For example, the following three arrays are a hill: [5,7,11,11,2,1], [4,4,2], [7],
but the following three are not unimodal: [5,5,6,6,1], [1,2,1,2], [4,5,5,6].

Write a program that checks if an array is a hill.

Input Format

The first line contains integer n (1<=n<=100) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains n integers a1,a2,...,an (1<=ai<=1000) — the elements of the array.

Output Format

Print "yes" if the given array is a hill. Otherwise, print "no".

Problem 5:
A little girl living in a village craves some rava idli even though she has had rava idli for the last 346514534 days in a row !! (Strange, you might think. But its normal down here)

At the idli shop there are two types of Rava Idli's available.

One goes for Rs.A per piece and the other goes for Rs.B per piece.
The girl has a total of K rupees.

What is the maximum number of rava idlis that she can have?

Note that she does not care about the type of idli she gets, she just wants to have as many rava idlis of any type as possible.

Input

The first line contains the number of test cases T
1 = T = 1000
Each test case contains three integers, A, B and K.
1 = A,B,K = 10^9

Output

Print the maximum number of idlis she can buy for each test case on a new line

Problem 6:
Python program to remove Nth occurrence of the given word. Given a list of words in Python, the task is to remove the Nth occurrence of the given word in that list.

Examples:

Input: list - ["Python", "for", "developers", "professionals", "developers"]
       word = developers, N = 2
Output: list - ["Python", "for", "developers", "professionals"]

Input: list - ["can", "you",  "can", "a", "can" "?"]
       word = can, N = 1
Output: list - ["you",  "can", "a", "can" "?"]

Problem 7:
Reverse words in a given String in Python
We are given a string and we need to reverse words of given string ?

Examples:

Input : str = "think career in IT think dlithe"
Output : str = "dlithe think IT in career think"

Problem 8:
Check if a Substring is Present in a Given String
Given two strings, check if s1 is there in s2.

Examples:

Input : s1 = "test" s2="this is testing"
Output : yes


Problem 9:
Python program to print even length words in a string
Given a string. The task is to print all words with even length in the given string.

Examples:

Input: s = "This is a python language"
Output: This
        is
        python
        language 

Input: s = "i am Dlithe"
Output: am
        Dlithe

Problem 10:
Program to check if a string contains any special character
Given a string, the task is to check if that string contains any special character (defined special character set). If any special character found, don’t accept that string.

Examples :

Input : Python$For$Developers
Output : String is not accepted.

Input : Python For Developers
Output : String is accepted
